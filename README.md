# youtube-like-challenge

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
* Add env.js with env.js.example content
* Modify the value of fake_results in env.js to false value to make live requests to the youTube api.


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Notes

* The results is not clickable as it's not one of the required tasks.
* The results returned from the api is limited to 25 results, there's no load more results.
* Mobile filters, I chose to do it as same as desktop.
* Due to limited time given work and studies, I didn't use `Flux Arch`.
* Of course to reach with the ui exactly the same as the given photos, time needed.
